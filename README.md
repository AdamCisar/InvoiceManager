# InvoiceManager

Invoice Manager is a custom application which automates process of price calculation. 

Previously this was done manually. We get an invoice from our supplier and then we need to process it to get our prices. Further, we create invoice for our customers.
Imagine if you have 2-5 pages of items like this, so you need to calculate price for more than 200 of them.

With buttons tax/without tax we select a different logic of calculation. This is because it dependes if we need to create invoice for tax payer or non tax payer.
In combobox button you can choose the type of business(supplier) that created invoice. Different business means different layout of items.
