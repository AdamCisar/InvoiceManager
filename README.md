# InvoiceManager

Invoice Manager is a custom application which automates process of price calculation. 

Previously this was done manually. We get an invoice from our supplier and then we need to process it to get our prices. Further, we create invoice for our customers.
Imagine if you have 2-5 pages of items like this, so you need to calculate price for more than 200 of them.
